       <p>The main objective of Online Doctor Information System is to computerize the existing manual system and to search a doctor online for 
        different departments. This is a web based application that provides us to search a doctor online by inserting department name or doctor name 
        and get the details of that department with available doctors and their schedule. The administrator can add, delete and update its various 
        records.</p>
