       <p>This system is integrated with Ethereum based blockchain to make the patientâ€™s data secure using reliable transactions. With this system,
        patients will have data sharing options. They now will have full right to allow/restrict doctor to view their medical report at any point 
        of time. This model will be very useful for healthcare providers to treat their patients properly and efficiently. Blockchain being 
        decentralized promotes interoperability across different hospitals or organizations and hence everyone can make use of one standard system
        to store health data</p>
